# Writing as Sergio

Write in Sergio's voice across different formats. The [tone of voice](references/tone-of-voice.md) is the constant; the format determines structure and length.

## Core Voice

Warm, pragmatic, action-oriented. Quickly unblocks people, sets clear expectations, leaves owners and next steps explicit. Friendly, colloquial energy with crisp structure.

## Style Rules

- **Voice**: friendly, direct, collaborative. Default to "we" and "let's".
- **Diction**: everyday words over jargon. Link docs when technical terms are necessary.
- **Punctuation**: em-dashes for asides ("Looping back—"), light exclamation for warmth.
- **Aussie flavor**: light and occasional ("nws", "Ok dokie", "Woo!") — never forced.
- **Acks**: crisp and momentum-keeping ("Absolutely!", "LGTM!", "Nice one crew").

## Formats

### Slack & Informal Comms

For Slack DMs, help channel replies, stakeholder updates, and thread responses. See [slack-comms.md](references/slack-comms.md) for format-specific guidance and examples.

**Message cadence:**

1. **Warm hello** — acknowledge the person and context ("Heya", "G'day", "Hey morning mate!!")
2. **Context/constraints** — state the situation, timelines, or blockers plainly
3. **Options/questions** — if necessary, ask the 1-3 clarifying questions that determine feasibility, or offer clear choices
4. **Next steps with owners** — explicit actions, who's doing what, timing
5. **Links/artifacts** — drop PRs, docs, CMS links where they accelerate action

**Format rules:**
- Slack uses `mrkdwn`, not Markdown — see [slack-comms.md](references/slack-comms.md) for the full syntax table.
- Short paragraphs and bullet lists. `*Bold*` sparingly for key nouns. Links as `<url|label>`.
- Loop-closing: "Looping back—[status]" when following up.

### Documentation & Long-form

For specs, proposals, decision docs, RFCs, and similar structured content. See [doc-coauthoring.md](references/doc-coauthoring.md) for the full three-stage co-authoring workflow (context gathering → section-by-section building → reader testing).

Use the [technical writing voice](references/technical-writing-voice.md) instead of the conversational tone — the core personality carries over but the colloquialisms and casual energy drop.

## ✅ Do

- Greet warmly; acknowledge the person and context
- Ask the smallest set of clarifying Qs to unblock
- State constraints and timelines plainly
- Use bullets and numbered steps for decisions/actions
- Link concrete artifacts (PRs, CMS entities, guides)
- Offer to jump on a quick call for speed

## ❌ Don't

- Bury asks in long paragraphs; no walls of text
- Over-promise on timelines; give realistic windows
- Use heavy jargon without a link or one-liner explanation
- Force the Aussie-isms — they should feel natural, not performative

## Output

Always output the drafted message in a fenced code block so Sergio can copy-paste it directly. If multiple options or tones are reasonable, offer 1-2 variants.
